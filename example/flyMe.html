<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section 1 is a <a href="/wiki/Vesting_clauses" title="Vesting clauses" class="mw-redirect">vesting clause</a>, granting all the federal government's legislative authority to Congress. Similar vesting clauses are found in Articles II and III, which grant "the <a href="/wiki/Executive_(government)" title="Executive (government)">executive power</a>" to the President and "the <a href="/wiki/Judiciary" title="Judiciary">judicial power</a>" to the federal judiciary. In legal proceedings, the working definition of "herein" connotes specificity and exclusivity. The Vesting Clauses thus establishes the principle of <a href="/wiki/Separation_of_powers_under_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Separation of powers under the United States Constitution">separation of powers</a> by specifically giving to each branch of the federal government only those powers it can exercise and no others.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> This means that no branch may exercise powers that properly belong to another (e.g., since the legislative power is only vested in Congress, the executive and judiciary may not enact laws).<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The language "herein granted" in Article I's vesting clause has been interpreted to mean that the powers Congress are to exercise are <i>exclusively</i> those specifically provided for in Article I.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> The clause "herein granted" was further defined and elaborated by the tenth amendment. Thus, this congressional clause is contrasted by the general vesting of the executive and judicial powers in Articles II and III in the branches of government those articles govern, which has been interpreted to mean that those branches enjoy "residual" or "implied" powers beyond those specifically mentioned, as contrasted with the Congress, which is vested with those legislative powers "herein granted;"<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> however, there is substantial contemporary disagreement about the precise extent of the powers conferred by the general vesting clauses.</p>
<p>As a corollary to the fact that Congress, and only Congress, is vested with the legislative power, Congress (in theory) cannot delegate legislative authority to other branches of government (e.g., the Executive Branch), a rule known as the <a href="/wiki/Nondelegation_doctrine" title="Nondelegation doctrine">nondelegation doctrine</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the Supreme Court has ruled that Congress does have latitude to delegate regulatory powers to executive agencies as long as it provides an "intelligible principle" which governs the agency's exercise of the delegated regulatory authority.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> In practice, the Supreme Court has only invalidated four statutes on non-delegation grounds in its history, three of which were invalidated in the mid-1930s. The fourth, the <a href="/wiki/Line_Item_Veto_Act_of_1996" title="Line Item Veto Act of 1996">Line Item Veto Act of 1996</a>, was invalidated in 1998.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The nondelegation doctrine is primarily used now as a way of interpreting a congressional delegation of authority narrowly,<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> in that the courts presume Congress intended only to delegate that which it certainly could have, unless it clearly demonstrates it intended to "test the waters" of what the courts would allow it to do.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although not specifically mentioned in the Constitution, Congress has also long asserted the power to investigate and the power to compel cooperation with an investigation.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> The Supreme Court has affirmed these powers as an implication of Congress's power to legislate.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Since the power to investigate is an aspect of Congress's power to legislate, it is as broad as Congress's powers to legislate.<sup id="cite_ref-investigate_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-investigate-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> However, it is also <i>limited</i> to inquiries that are "in aid of the legislative function;"<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Congress may not "expose for the sake of exposure."<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> It is uncontroversial that a proper subject of Congress's investigation power is the operations of the federal government, but Congress's ability to compel the submission of documents or testimony from the President or his subordinates is often-discussed and sometimes controversial (see <a href="/wiki/Executive_privilege" title="Executive privilege">executive privilege</a>), although not often litigated. As a practical matter, the limitation of Congress's ability to investigate only for a proper purpose ("in aid of" its legislative powers) functions as a limit on Congress's ability to investigate the private affairs of individual citizens; matters that simply demand action by another branch of government, without implicating an issue of public policy necessitating legislation by Congress, must be left to those branches due to the doctrine of separation of powers.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The courts are highly deferential to Congress's exercise of its investigation powers, however. Congress has the power to investigate that which it could regulate,<sup id="cite_ref-investigate_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-investigate-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> and the courts have interpreted Congress's regulatory powers broadly since the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>.</p>
<p>Additionally, the courts will not inquire into whether Congress has an improper motive for an investigation (i.e., using a legitimate legislative purpose as a cover for "expos[ing] for the sake of exposure"), focusing only on whether the matter is within Congress's power to regulate and, thus, investigate.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Persons called before a congressional investigatory committee are entitled to the constitutional guarantees of individual rights, such as those in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights" title="United States Bill of Rights">Bill of Rights</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Congress can punish those who do not cooperate with an investigation via holding violators in <a href="/wiki/Contempt_of_Congress" title="Contempt of Congress">contempt of Congress</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen every second Year by the People of the several States, and the Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Section Two provides for the election of the House of Representatives every second year. Since Representatives are to be "chosen... by the People," State Governors are not allowed to appoint temporary replacements when vacancies occur in a state's delegation to the House of Representatives; instead, the Governor of the state is required by <a href="Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Article One of the United States Constitution">clause 4</a> to issue a <a href="/wiki/Writ_of_election" title="Writ of election">writ of election</a> calling a special election to fill the vacancy.</p>
<p>At the time of its creation, the Constitution did not explicitly give citizens an inherent right to vote.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Rather, it provided that those qualified to vote in elections for the largest chamber of a state's legislature may vote in Congressional (House of Representatives) elections. Since the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">Civil War</a>, several constitutional amendments have been enacted that have curbed the states' broad powers to set voter qualification standards. Though never enforced, clause 2 of the <a href="/wiki/Fourteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_ConstitutionApportionment_of_representation_in_House_of_Representatives" title="Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fourteenth Amendment</a> provides that <i>when the right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for President and Vice President of the United States, Representatives in Congress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the members of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the male inhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens of the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation in rebellion, or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall be reduced in the proportion which the number of such male citizens shall bear to the whole number of male citizens twenty-one years of age in such State.</i> The <a href="/wiki/Fifteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Fifteenth Amendment</a> prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on race, color, or previous condition of servitude. The <a href="/wiki/Nineteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Nineteenth Amendment</a> prohibits the denial of the right to vote based on sex. The <a href="/wiki/Twenty-fourth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Twenty-fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-fourth Amendment</a> prohibits the revocation of voting rights due to the non-payment of a <a href="/wiki/Poll_tax" title="Poll tax" class="mw-redirect">poll tax</a>. The <a href="/wiki/Twenty-sixth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twenty-sixth Amendment</a> prohibits the denial of the right of US citizens, eighteen years of age or older, to vote on account of age.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the Supreme Court has recognized voting as a fundamental right,<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup> the <a href="/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause" title="Equal Protection Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a> places very tight limitations (albeit with uncertain limits) on the states' ability to define voter qualifications; it is fair to say that qualifications beyond citizenship, residency, and age are usually questionable.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In the 1960s, the Supreme Court started to view voting as a fundamental right covered by the <a href="/wiki/Equal_Protection_Clause" title="Equal Protection Clause">Equal Protection Clause</a> of the Fourteenth Amendment.<sup id="cite_ref-Briffault_22-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Briffault-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> In a dissenting opinion of a 1964 Supreme Court case involving <a href="/wiki/Reapportionment" title="Reapportionment" class="mw-redirect">reapportionment</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Alabama" title="Alabama">Alabama</a> state legislature, Associate Justice <a href="/wiki/John_Marshall_Harlan_II" title="John Marshall Harlan II">John Marshall Harlan II</a> included <i>Minor</i> in a list of past decisions about voting and apportionment which were no longer being followed.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Since <a href="/wiki/Article_One_of_the_United_States_Constitution Section_2.2C_Clause_3_Apportionment" title="Article One of the United States Constitution">clause 3</a> provides that Members of the House of Representatives are apportioned state-by-state and that each state is guaranteed at least one Representative, exact population equality between all districts is not guaranteed and, in fact, is currently impossible, because while the size of the House of Representatives is fixed at 435, several states had less than 1/435 of the national population at the time of the last reapportionment in 2000.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> However, the Supreme Court has interpreted the provision of Clause One that Representatives shall be elected "by the People" to mean that, in those states with more than one member of the House of Representatives, each congressional election district within the state must have nearly identical populations.<sup id="cite_ref-wesberry_25-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wesberry-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Constitution provides three requirements for Representatives: A Representative must be at least 25 years old, must be an inhabitant of the state in which he or she is elected, and must have been a <a href="/wiki/Citizen_of_the_United_States" title="Citizen of the United States" class="mw-redirect">citizen of the United States</a> for the previous seven years.

<p>After much debate, the framers of the Constitution decided to make population the basis of apportioning the seats in the House of Representatives and the tax liability among the states. To facilitate this, the Constitution mandates that a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Census" title="United States Census">census</a> be conducted every ten years to determine the population of each state and of the nation as a whole and establishes a rule for who shall be counted or excluded from the count. As the new form of government most certainly become operational prior to the completion of a national census, the Constitution also provides for a temporary apportionment of seats in the mean time.</p>
<p>Originally, the population of each state and of the nation as a whole was ascertained by adding to the whole number of free Persons, three-fifths the number of all other Persons (i.e., <a href="/wiki/Slave" title="Slave" class="mw-redirect">slaves</a> , but excluding non-taxed <a href="/wiki/Native_Americans_in_the_United_States" title="Native Americans in the United States">Native Americans</a>. This Constitutional rule, known as the <a href="/wiki/Three-fifths_compromise" title="Three-fifths compromise" class="mw-redirect">three-fifths compromise</a>, was a compromise between Southern and Northern states in which three-fifths of the population of slaves would be counted for <a href="/wiki/Enumeration" title="Enumeration">enumeration</a> purposes and for the apportionment of seats in the House of Representatives and of taxes among the states. It was, according to <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> <a href="/wiki/Associate_Justice_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States">Justice</a> <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Story" title="Joseph Story">Joseph Story</a> (writing in <a href="/wiki/Commentaries_on_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States" title="Commentaries on the Constitution of the United States">1833</a>), "a matter of compromise and concession, confessedly unequal in its operation, but a necessary sacrifice to that spirit of conciliation, which was indispensable to the union of states having a great diversity of interests, and physical condition, and political institutions".<sup id="cite_ref-30" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Following the completion of each census, Congress is empowered to use the aggregate population in all the states (according to the prevailing Constitutional rule for determining population) to determine the relative population of each state to the population of the whole, and, based on its calculations, to establish the appropriate size of the House<sup id="cite_ref-prigg_31-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-prigg-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup> and to allocate a particular number of representatives to each state according to its share of the national population.</p>
<p>Since enactment of the <a href="/wiki/Reapportionment_Act_of_1929" title="Reapportionment Act of 1929">Reapportionment Act of 1929</a>, a constant 435 House seats have been apportioned among the states according to each census, and determining the size of the House is not presently part of the apportionment process. With one exception, the apportionment of 1842, the House of Representatives had been enlarged by various degrees from sixty-five members in 1788 to 435 members by 1913. The determination of size was made based on the aggregate national population, so long as the size of the House did not exceed 1 member for every 30,000 of the country's total population<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup> nor the size of any state's delegation exceed 1 for every 30,000 of that state's population.<sup id="cite_ref-33" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup> With the size of the House still fixed at 435, the current ratio, as of the <a href="/wiki/2010_United_States_Census" title="2010 United States Census">2010 Census</a>, is around 1 Representative: 700,000 Citizens.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Although the first sentence in this clause originally concerned apportionment of both House seats and taxes among the several states, the Fourteenth Amendment sentence that replaced it in 1868 mentioned only the apportionment of House seats. Even so, the constraint placed upon Congress' taxation power remained, as the restriction was reiterated in Article 1 Section 9 Clause 4. The amount of <a href="/wiki/Direct_taxes" title="Direct taxes" class="mw-redirect">direct taxes</a> that could be collected by the federal government from the people in any State would still be tied directly to that state's share of the national population.</p>
<p>Due to this restriction, application of the <a href="/wiki/Income_tax" title="Income tax">income tax</a> to income derived from real estate and specifically income in the form of dividends from personal property ownership such as stock shares was found to be unconstitutional because it was not apportioned among the states;<sup id="cite_ref-35" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-35"><span>[</span>35<span>]</span></a></sup> that is to say, there was no guarantee that a State with 10% of the country's population paid 10% of those income taxes collected, because Congress had not fixed an amount of money to be raised and apportioned it between the States according to their respective shares of the national population. To permit the levying of such an income tax, Congress proposed and the states ratified the <a href="/wiki/Sixteenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Sixteenth Amendment</a>, which removed the restriction by specifically providing that Congress could levy a tax on income "from whatever source derived" without it being apportioned among the States or otherwise based on a State's share of the national population.</p>

<p>Section Three provides that each state is entitled to two Senators chosen for a term of six years. The <a href="/wiki/State_legislature_(United_States)" title="State legislature (United States)">state legislatures</a> originally chose the means of choosing the Senators. This provision has been superseded in 1913 by the <a href="/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a>, which provides for the direct election of Senators by the respective states' voters.</p>

Section Three of Article I is one of a handful of clauses on which Article Five places special restrictions to be amended; in this case, Article Five provides that "no State, without its Consent, shall be deprived of its equal Suffrage in the Senate." Thus, no individual state may have its representation in the Senate adjusted without its consent unless all other states have an identical change. That is to say, an amendment that changed this clause to provide that all states would get only one Senator (or three Senators, or any other number) could be ratified through the normal process, but an amendment that provided for some basis of representation other than strict numerical equality (for example, population, wealth, or land area) would require the assent of every state.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>After the first group of Senators was elected to the <a href="/wiki/1st_United_States_Congress" title="1st United States Congress">First Congress</a> (1789–1791), the Senators were divided into <a href="/wiki/Classes_of_United_States_Senators" title="Classes of United States Senators">three "classes"</a> as nearly equal in size as possible, as required by this section. This was done in May 1789 <a href="/wiki/Sortition" title="Sortition">by lot</a>. Those Senators grouped in the first class had their term expire after only two years; those Senators in the second class had their term expire after only four years, instead of six. After this, all Senators from those States have been elected to six-year terms, and as new States have joined the Union, their Senate seats have been assigned to one of the three classes, maintaining each grouping as nearly equal in size as possible. In this way, election is staggered; approximately one-third of the Senate is up for re-election every two years, but the entire body is never up for re-election in the same year (as contrasted with the House, where its entire membership is up for re-election every 2 years).</p>
<p>As originally established, Senators were elected by the Legislature of the State they represented in the Senate. If a senator died, resigned, or was expelled, the legislature of the state would appoint a replacement to serve out the remainder of the senator's term. If the State Legislature was not in session, its Governor could appoint a temporary replacement to serve until the legislature could elect a permanent replacement. This was superseded by the <a href="/wiki/Seventeenth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Seventeenth Amendment</a>, which provided for the Popular Election of Senators, instead of their appointment by the State Legislature. In a nod to the less populist nature of the Senate, the Amendment tracks the vacancy procedures for the House of Representatives in requiring that the Governor call a special election to fill the vacancy, but (unlike in the House) it vests in the State Legislature the authority to allow the Governor to appoint a temporary replacement until the special election is held. Note, however, that under the original Constitution, the Governors of the states were expressly allowed by the Constitution to make temporary appointments. The current system, under the Seventeenth Amendment, allows Governors to appoint a replacement only if their state legislature has previously decided to allow the Governor to do so; otherwise, the seat must remain vacant until the special election is held to fill the seat, as in the case of a vacancy in the House.</p>

The <a href="/wiki/Chief_Justice_of_the_United_States" title="Chief Justice of the United States">Chief Justice</a> presides whenever the President of the United States is tried, to avoid the Vice President exercising his duties as President of the Senate and presiding over the trial of the President of the United States. Although this was probably originally intended to avoid a situation where the Vice President was presiding over a debate that could ultimately result in his promotion to the presidency (were the President convicted and removed from office), it also prevents a possibly more likely contemporary scenario, where a President accused of some offense is being tried by the Senate presided over by a Vice President who may well be sympathetic to the President, reducing the independence of the Senate's consideration of the delicate question of whether to remove a sitting chief executive. On the other hand, nothing prevents the curious circumstance of a Vice President presiding over his <i>own</i> impeachment trial as President of the Senate, should he be impeached (although this has never happened).</p>
<p>A two-thirds supermajority of those Senators present is required to convict, although given the obvious importance of impeachment proceedings, there are generally few absent members.

</blockquote>
<p>This clause generally commits to the States the authority to determine the "times, places and manner of holding elections," which includes the preliminary stages of the election process (such as a primary election), while reserving to Congress the authority to preempt State regulations with uniform national rules.<sup id="cite_ref-43" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-43"><span>[</span>43<span>]</span></a></sup> Congress has exercised this authority to determine a <a href="/wiki/Election_Day_(United_States)" title="Election Day (United States)">uniform date</a> for federal elections: the Tuesday following the first Monday in November.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-44"><span>[</span>44<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Because Congress has not enacted any on-point regulations, States still retain the authority to regulate the dates on which other aspects of the election process are held (registration, primary elections, etc.) and where elections will be held. As for regulating the "manner" of elections, the Supreme Court has interpreted this to mean "matters like notices, registration, supervision of voting, protection of voters, prevention of fraud and corrupt practices, counting of votes, duties of inspectors and canvassers, and making and publication of election returns."<sup id="cite_ref-45" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-45"><span>[</span>45<span>]</span></a></sup> The Supreme Court has held that States may <i>not</i> exercise their power to determine the "manner" of holding elections to impose term limits on their congressional delegation.<sup id="cite_ref-thornton_29-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-thornton-29"><span>[</span>29<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>One of the most significant ways that States regulate the "manner" of elections is their power to draw election districts. Although in theory Congress could draw the district map for each State,<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> it has not exercised this level of oversight. Congress has, however, required the States to conform to certain practices when drawing districts. States are currently required to use a single-member district scheme, whereby the State is divided into as many election districts for Representatives in the House of Representatives as the size of its representation in that body (that is to say, Representatives cannot be elected at-large from the whole State unless the State has only one Representative in the House, nor can districts elect more than 1 Representative).<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Congress once imposed additional requirements that districts be composed of contiguous territory, be "compact," and have equal populations within each State.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup> Congress has allowed those requirements to lapse,<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup> but the Supreme Court has re-imposed the population requirement on the States under the Equal Protection Clause<sup id="cite_ref-wesberry_25-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-wesberry-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> and is suspicious of districts that do not meet the other "traditional" districting criteria of compactness and contiguity.<sup id="cite_ref-50" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-50"><span>[</span>50<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The restriction on Congress's inability to "make or alter" regulations pertaining to the places of choosing Senators is largely an anachronism. When State Legislatures selected Senators, if Congress had been able to prescribe the place for choosing Senators, it could have in effect told each State where its state capital must be located. This would have been offensive to the concept of each State being <a href="/wiki/SovereigntySovereignty_and_federalism" title="Sovereignty">sovereign</a> over its own internal affairs. Now that Senators are popularly elected, it is largely a moot point.</p>

<blockquote class="templatequote">
<p>The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year, and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless they shall by Law appoint a different Day.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Clause 2 requires that Congress must assemble at least once each year. This was designed to force Congress to make itself available at least once in a year to provide the legislative action the country needed in the face of the transportation and communication challenges present in the 18th century. In modern practice, Congress is in session virtually year-round.</p>
<p>Originally, the Constitution provided that the annual meeting was to be on the first Monday in December unless otherwise provided by law. The government under the Articles of Confederation had determined, as a transitional measure to the new constitution, that the date for "commencing proceedings" under the U.S. Constitution would be March 4, 1789.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup> Since the first term of the original federal officials began on this date and ended 2, 4, or 6 years later, this became the date on which new federal officials took office in subsequent years. This meant that, every other year, although a new Congress was elected in November, it did not come into office until the following March, with a "<a href="/wiki/Lame_duck_(politics)" title="Lame duck (politics)">lame duck</a>" Congress convening in the interim. As modern communications and travel made it less necessary to wait 4 months from Election Day to the swearing-in of the elected officials, it became increasingly cumbersome to elect officials in November but wait until March for them to take office. Congress eventually proposed that elected officials take office in January, instead of March; since this required cutting short (by a couple of months) the terms of the elected federal officials at the time of the proposal, Congress proposed the <a href="/wiki/Twentieth_Amendment_to_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution">Twentieth Amendment</a>, which established the present dates for when federal officials take office. While the Constitution always granted Congress the authority to meet on a different day without the need to pass an amendment, § 2 of the Twentieth Amendment "tidied up" the constitutional text by paralleling the original provision requiring that the Congress meet at least once a year in December, and changing it to January 3 (unless changed by law). Although the original Constitution allowed Congress to change its annual meeting date by statute, this change eliminated any reference to a requirement in the Constitution that a lame duck Congress meet in the period between the election of a new Congress and its taking office.</p>

<p>This clause is known as the <a href="/wiki/Presentment_Clause" title="Presentment Clause">Presentment Clause</a>. Before a bill becomes law, it must be presented to the President, who has ten days (excluding Sundays) to act upon it. If the President signs the bill, it becomes law.

The bill does not then become law unless both Houses, by two-thirds votes, override the veto. If the President neither signs nor returns the bill within the ten-day limit, the bill becomes law, unless the Congress has adjourned in the meantime, thereby preventing the President from returning the bill to the House in which it originated.

Since neither House of Congress was in session, the President could not return the bill to one of them, thereby permitting the use of the pocket veto. In <i><a href="/wiki/Wright_v._United_States" title="Wright v. United States">Wright v.

</blockquote>
<p>In 1996, Congress passed the <a href="/wiki/Line_Item_Veto_Act_of_1996" title="Line Item Veto Act of 1996">Line Item Veto Act</a>, which permitted the President, at the time of the signing of the bill, to rescind certain expenditures. The Congress could disapprove the cancellation and reinstate the funds. The President could veto the disapproval, but the Congress, by a two-thirds vote in each House, could override the veto. In the case <i><a href="/wiki/Clinton_v._City_of_New_York" title="Clinton v. City of New York">Clinton v. City of New York</a></i>, the Supreme Court found the Line Item Veto Act unconstitutional because it violated the Presentment clause. First, the procedure delegated legislative powers to the President, thereby violating the nondelegation doctrine. Second, the procedure violated the terms of Section Seven, which state, "if he approve [the bill] he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it." Thus, the President may sign the bill, veto it, or do nothing, but he may not amend the bill and then sign it.</p>
<p>Every bill, order, resolution, or vote that must be passed by both Houses, except on a question of adjournment, must be presented to the President before becoming law. However, to propose a constitutional amendment, two-thirds of both Houses may submit it to the states for the ratification, without any consideration by the President, as prescribed in <a href="/wiki/Article_Five_of_the_United_States_Constitution" title="Article Five of the United States Constitution">Article V</a>.</p>
<p>Some Presidents have made very extensive use of the veto, while others have not used it at all. <a href="/wiki/Grover_Cleveland" title="Grover Cleveland">Grover Cleveland</a>, for instance, vetoed over four hundred bills during his first term in office; Congress overrode only two of those vetoes. Meanwhile, seven Presidents have never used the veto power.

</blockquote>
<p>Many powers of Congress have been interpreted broadly. Most notably, the Taxing and Spending, Interstate Commerce, and Necessary and Proper Clauses have been deemed to grant expansive powers to Congress.</p>
<p>Congress may lay and collect taxes for the "common defense" or "general welfare" of the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has not often defined "general welfare," leaving the <a href="/wiki/Political_question" title="Political question">political question</a> to Congress. In <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Butler" title="United States v. Butler">United States v. Butler</a></i> (1936), the Court for the first time construed the clause. The dispute centered on a tax collected from processors of agricultural products such as meat; the funds raised by the tax were not paid into the general funds of the treasury, but were rather specially earmarked for farmers. The Court struck down the tax, ruling that the general welfare language in the Taxing and Spending Clause related only to "matters of national, as distinguished from local, welfare". Congress continues to make expansive use of the <a href="/wiki/Taxing_and_Spending_Clause" title="Taxing and Spending Clause">Taxing and Spending Clause</a>; for instance, the <a href="/wiki/Social_security" title="Social security">social security</a> program is authorized under the Taxing and Spending Clause.</p>
<p>Congress has the power to borrow money on the credit of the United States. In 1871, when deciding <i><a href="/wiki/Knox_v._Lee" title="Knox v. Lee">Knox v. Lee</a>,</i> the Court ruled that this clause permitted Congress to emit bills and make them legal tender in satisfaction of debts. Whenever Congress borrows money, it is obligated to repay the sum as stipulated in the original agreement. However, such agreements are only "binding on the conscience of the sovereign", as the doctrine of <a href="/wiki/Sovereign_immunity" title="Sovereign immunity">sovereign immunity</a> prevents a creditor from suing in court if the government reneges its commitment.<sup id="cite_ref-58" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-58"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</blockquote>
<p>The Supreme Court has seldom restrained the use of the <i><a href="/wiki/Commerce_clause" title="Commerce clause" class="mw-redirect">commerce clause</a></i> for widely varying purposes. The first important decision related to the commerce clause was <i><a href="/wiki/Gibbons_v._Ogden" title="Gibbons v. Ogden">Gibbons v. Ogden</a></i>, decided by a unanimous Court in 1824. The case involved conflicting federal and state laws: <a href="/w/index.php?title=Thomas_Gibbons_(politician)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" class="new" title="Thomas Gibbons (politician) (page does not exist)">Thomas Gibbons</a> had a federal permit to navigate steamboats in the <a href="/wiki/Hudson_River" title="Hudson River">Hudson River</a>, while the other, <a href="/wiki/Aaron_Ogden" title="Aaron Ogden">Aaron Ogden</a>, had a monopoly to do the same granted by the state of New York. Ogden contended that "commerce" included only buying and selling of goods and not their transportation. Chief Justice <a href="/wiki/John_Marshall" title="John Marshall">John Marshall</a> rejected this notion. Marshall suggested that "commerce" included navigation of goods, and that it "must have been contemplated" by the Framers. Marshall added that Congress's power over commerce "is complete in itself, may be exercised to its utmost extent, and acknowledges no limitations other than are prescribed in the Constitution".</p>
<p>The expansive interpretation of the Commerce Clause was restrained during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when a <i><a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a></i> attitude dominated the Court. In <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._E._C._Knight_Company" title="United States v. E. C. Knight Company" class="mw-redirect">United States v. E. C. Knight Company</a></i> (1895), the Supreme Court limited the newly enacted <a href="/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a>, which had sought to break up the monopolies dominating the nation's economy. The Court ruled that Congress could not regulate the manufacture of goods, even if they were later shipped to other states. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote, "commerce succeeds to manufacture, and is not a part of it."</p>
<p>The U.S. Supreme Court sometimes ruled <a href="/wiki/New_Deal" title="New Deal">New Deal</a> programs unconstitutional because they stretched the meaning of the commerce clause. In <i><a href="/wiki/Schechter_Poultry_Corp._v._United_States" title="Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States">Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States</a>,</i> (1935) the Court unanimously struck down industrial codes regulating the slaughter of poultry, declaring that Congress could not regulate commerce relating to the poultry, which had "come to a permanent rest within the State." As Chief Justice <a href="/wiki/Charles_Evans_Hughes" title="Charles Evans Hughes">Charles Evans Hughes</a> put it, "so far as the poultry here in question is concerned, the flow of interstate commerce has ceased." Judicial rulings against attempted use of Congress's Commerce Clause powers continued during the 1930s.</p>
<p>It was only in 1937 that the Supreme Court gave up the <i><a href="/wiki/Laissez-faire" title="Laissez-faire">laissez-faire</a></i> doctrine as it decided a landmark case, <i><a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Board_v._Jones_%26_Laughlin_Steel_Company" title="National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company" class="mw-redirect">National Labor Relations Board v. Jones &amp; Laughlin Steel Company</a>.</i> The legislation in question, the <a href="/wiki/National_Labor_Relations_Act" title="National Labor Relations Act">National Labor Relations Act</a>, prevented employers from engaging in "<a href="/wiki/Unfair_labor_practice" title="Unfair labor practice">unfair labor practices</a>" such as firing workers for joining <a href="/wiki/Labor_union" title="Labor union" class="mw-redirect">unions</a>. The Court ruled to sustain the Act's provisions. The Court, returning to the theories propounded by John Marshall, ruled that Congress could pass laws regulating actions that even indirectly influenced interstate commerce. Further decisions expanded the Congress's powers under the commerce clause. This dramatic change in the Court's thinking was influenced by the threat of President <a href="/wiki/Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Judiciary_Reorganization_Bill_of_1937" title="Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937" class="mw-redirect">Court Packing</a> scheme.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, the Court acted to restrain Congress's exercise of its power to regulate commerce. In <i><a href="/wiki/United_States_v._Lopez" title="United States v. Lopez">United States v. Lopez</a></i>, the Court found that Congress could not exercise "<a href="/wiki/Police_power_(United_States_constitutional_law)" title="Police power (United States constitutional law)">Police power</a>" reserved to the States by use of the Commerce Clause.</p>
<p>In contrast to <i>United States v. Lopez</i> , the powers defined in the Commerce Clause have been elastically re-interpreted to cover non-commercial activity not just between but within the states. In 2005, the Supreme Court controversially ruled in <i><a href="/wiki/Gonzales_v._Raich" title="Gonzales v. Raich">Gonzales v. Raich</a>,</i> that the Commerce Clause granted Congress the authority to regulate <i><a href="/wiki/Cannabis_(drug)" title="Cannabis (drug)">cannabis</a></i> plants grown, processed, and consumed within the state on private property. The court reclassified the plant as a commodity even though it was not sold or exchanged in any transaction.</p>

<p>Congress may establish uniform laws relating to <a href="/wiki/Naturalization" title="Naturalization">naturalization</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy" title="Bankruptcy">bankruptcy</a>. It may also coin money, regulate the value of American or foreign currency and punish counterfeiters. Congress may fix the standards of weights and measures. Furthermore, Congress may establish <a href="/wiki/Postal_Clause" title="Postal Clause">post offices and post roads</a> (the roads, however, need not be exclusively for the conveyance of mail). Congress may promote the progress of science and useful arts by granting <a href="/wiki/United_States_copyright_law" title="United States copyright law" class="mw-redirect">copyrights</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_patent_law" title="United States patent law">patents</a> of limited duration. Section eight, clause eight of Article One, known as the <a href="/wiki/Copyright_Clause" title="Copyright Clause">Copyright Clause</a>, is the only instance of the word "right" used in the original constitution (though the word does appear in several Amendments).<sup id="cite_ref-59" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-59"><span>[</span>58<span>]</span></a></sup> Though perpetual copyrights and patents are prohibited, the Supreme Court has ruled in <i><a href="/wiki/Eldred_v._Ashcroft" title="Eldred v. Ashcroft">Eldred v. Ashcroft</a></i> (2003) that repeated extensions to the term of copyright do not constitute perpetual copyright; also note that this is the only power granted where the means to accomplish its stated purpose is specifically provided for. Courts inferior to the Supreme Court may be established by Congress.</p>
<p>Congress has several powers related to war and the armed forces. Under the <a href="/wiki/War_Powers_Clause" title="War Powers Clause">War Powers Clause</a>, only Congress may declare war, but in several cases it has, without declaring war, granted the President the authority to engage in military conflicts. Five wars have been declared in United States' history: the <a href="/wiki/War_of_1812" title="War of 1812">War of 1812</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Mexican-American_War" title="Mexican-American War" class="mw-redirect">Mexican-American War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Spanish-American_War" title="Spanish-American War" class="mw-redirect">Spanish-American War</a>, <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>. Some historians argue that the legal doctrines and legislation passed during the operations against <a href="/wiki/Pancho_Villa" title="Pancho Villa">Pancho Villa</a> constitute a sixth declaration of war. Congress may grant <a href="/wiki/Letter_of_marque" title="Letter of marque">letters of marque</a> and <a href="/wiki/Reprisal" title="Reprisal">reprisal</a>. Congress may establish and support the armed forces, but no appropriation made for the support of the army may be used for more than two years. This provision was inserted because the Framers feared the establishment of a standing army, beyond civilian control, during peacetime. Congress may regulate or call forth the state militias, but the states retain the authority to appoint officers and train personnel. Congress also has exclusive power to make rules and regulations governing the land and naval forces. Although the executive branch and the Pentagon have asserted an ever-increasing measure of involvement in this process, the U.S. Supreme Court has often reaffirmed Congress's exclusive hold on this power (e.g. Burns v. Wilson, 346 U.S. 137 (1953)). Congress used this power twice soon after World War II with the enactment of two statutes: the <a href="/wiki/Uniform_Code_of_Military_Justice" title="Uniform Code of Military Justice">Uniform Code of Military Justice</a> to improve the quality and fairness of courts martial and military justice, and the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Tort_Claims_Act" title="Federal Tort Claims Act">Federal Tort Claims Act</a> which among other rights had allowed military service persons to sue for damages until the U.S. Supreme Court repealed that section of the statute in a divisive series of cases, known collectively as the <a href="/wiki/Feres_v._United_States" title="Feres v. United States">Feres Doctrine</a>.</p>
<p>Congress has the exclusive right to legislate "in all cases whatsoever" for the nation's capital, the <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">District of Columbia</a>. Congress chooses to devolve some of such authority to the elected <a href="/wiki/Mayor_of_Washington,_D.C." title="Mayor of Washington, D.C." class="mw-redirect">mayor</a> and <a href="/wiki/Council_of_the_District_of_Columbia" title="Council of the District of Columbia">council</a> of District of Columbia. Nevertheless, Congress remains free to enact any legislation for the District so long as constitutionally permissible, to overturn any legislation by the city government, and technically to revoke the city government at any time. Congress may also exercise such jurisdiction over land purchased from the states for the erection of forts and other buildings.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Finally, Congress has the power to do whatever is "necessary and proper" to carry out its enumerated powers and, crucially, all others vested in it. This has been interpreted to authorize criminal prosecution of those whose actions have a "substantial effect" on interstate commerce in <i>Wickard v. Filburn</i>&nbsp;; however, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a>, in the <a href="/wiki/Kentucky_Resolutions" title="Kentucky Resolutions" class="mw-redirect">Kentucky Resolutions</a>, supported by <a href="/wiki/James_Madison" title="James Madison">James Madison</a>, maintained that a penal power could not be inferred from a power to regulate, and that the only penal powers were for <a href="/wiki/Treason" title="Treason">treason</a>, <a href="/wiki/Counterfeiting" title="Counterfeiting" class="mw-redirect">counterfeiting</a>, <a href="/wiki/Piracy" title="Piracy">piracy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Felony" title="Felony">felony</a> on the <a href="/wiki/High_seas" title="High seas" class="mw-redirect">high seas</a>, and offenses against the <a href="/wiki/Law_of_nations" title="Law of nations" class="mw-redirect">law of nations</a>.</p>
<p>The necessary and proper clause has been interpreted extremely broadly, thereby giving Congress wide latitude in legislation. The first landmark case involving the clause was <i><a href="/wiki/McCulloch_v._Maryland" title="McCulloch v. Maryland">McCulloch v. Maryland</a></i> (1819), which involved the establishment of a <a href="/wiki/Second_Bank_of_the_United_States" title="Second Bank of the United States">national bank</a>. <a href="/wiki/Alexander_Hamilton" title="Alexander Hamilton">Alexander Hamilton</a>, in advocating the creation of the bank, argued that there was "a more or less direct" relationship between the bank and "the powers of collecting taxes, borrowing money, regulating trade between the states, and raising and maintaining fleets and navies". <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Jefferson" title="Thomas Jefferson">Thomas Jefferson</a> countered that Congress's powers "can all be carried into execution without a national bank. A bank therefore is not necessary, and consequently not authorized by this phrase". Chief Justice John Marshall agreed with the former interpretation. Marshall wrote that a Constitution listing <i>all</i> of Congress's powers "would partake of a prolixity of a legal code and could scarcely be embraced by the human mind". Since the Constitution could not possibly enumerate the "minor ingredients" of the powers of Congress, Marshall "deduced" that Congress had the authority to establish a bank from the "great outlines" of the general welfare, commerce and other clauses. Under this doctrine of the necessary and proper clause, Congress has sweepingly broad powers (known as <a href="/wiki/Implied_powers" title="Implied powers">implied powers</a>) not explicitly enumerated in the Constitution. However, the Congress cannot enact laws solely on the implied powers, any action must be necessary and proper in the execution of the enumerated powers.</p>

<p>States may not exercise certain powers reserved for the federal government: they may not enter into treaties, alliances or confederations, grant letters of marque or reprisal, coin money or issue bills of credit (such as currency). Furthermore, no state may make anything but gold and silver coin a tender in payment of debts, which expressly forbids any state government (but not the federal government<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61"><span>[</span>60<span>]</span></a></sup>) from "making a tender" (i.e., authorizing something that may be offered in payment<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup>) of any type or form of <a href="/wiki/Money" title="Money">money</a> to meet any financial obligation,<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup> unless that form of money is coins made of gold or silver (or a medium of exchange backed by and redeemable in gold or silver coins, as noted in <i>Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v.

Much of this clause is devoted to preventing the States from using or creating any currency other than that created by Congress. In Federalist no. 44, Madison explains that "... it may be observed that the same reasons which shew the necessity of denying to the States the power of regulating coin, prove with equal force that they ought not to be at liberty to substitute a paper medium in the place of coin. Had every State a right to regulate the value of its coin, there might be as many different currencies as States; and thus the intercourse among them would be impeded."<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup> Moreover, the states may not pass bills of attainder, <i>ex post facto</i> laws, impair the obligation of contracts or grant titles of nobility.</p>
<p>The <a href="/wiki/Contract_Clause" title="Contract Clause">Contract Clause</a> was the subject of much contentious litigation in the 19th century. It was first interpreted by the Supreme Court in 1810, when <i><a href="/wiki/Fletcher_v._Peck" title="Fletcher v. Peck">Fletcher v. Peck</a></i> was decided. The case involved the <a href="/wiki/Yazoo_land_scandal" title="Yazoo land scandal">Yazoo land scandal</a>, in which the <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a> legislature authorized the sale of land to speculators at low prices. The bribery involved in the passage of the authorizing legislation was so blatant that a Georgia mob attempted to lynch the corrupt members of the legislature. Following elections, the legislature passed a law that rescinded the contracts granted by the corrupt legislators. The validity of the annulment of the sale was questioned in the Supreme Court. In writing for a unanimous court, Chief Justice John Marshall asked, "What is a contract?" His answer was: "a compact between two or more parties." Marshall argued that the sale of land by the Georgia legislature, though fraught with corruption, was a valid "contract". He added that the state had no right to annul the purchase of the land, since doing so would impair the obligations of contract.</p>
<p>The definition of a contract propounded by Chief Justice Marshall was not as simple as it may seem. In 1819, the Court considered whether a corporate charter could be construed as a contract. The case of <i><a href="/wiki/Trustees_of_Dartmouth_College_v._Woodward" title="Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward" class="mw-redirect">Trustees of Dartmouth College v. Woodward</a></i> involved <a href="/wiki/Dartmouth_College" title="Dartmouth College">Dartmouth College</a>, which had been established under a Royal Charter granted by King <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="George III of the United Kingdom">George III</a>. The Charter created a board of twelve trustees for the governance of the College. In 1815, however, <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> passed a law increasing the board's membership to twenty-one with the aim that public control could be exercised over the College. The Court, including Marshall, ruled that New Hampshire could not amend the charter, which was ruled to be a contract since it conferred "vested rights" on the trustees.</p>
<p>The Marshall Court determined another dispute in <i><a href="/wiki/Sturges_v._Crowninshield" title="Sturges v. Crowninshield">Sturges v. Crowninshield</a></i>. The case involved a debt that was contracted in early 1811. Later in that year, the state of New York passed a bankruptcy law, under which the debt was later discharged. The Supreme Court ruled that a retroactively applied state bankruptcy law impaired the obligation to pay the debt, and therefore violated the Constitution. In <i><a href="/wiki/Ogden_v._Saunders" title="Ogden v. Saunders">Ogden v. Saunders</a></i> (1827), however, the court decided that state bankruptcy laws <i>could</i> apply to debts contracted after the passage of the law. State legislation on the issue of bankruptcy and debtor relief has not been much of an issue since the adoption of a comprehensive <a href="/wiki/Bankruptcy_in_the_United_States" title="Bankruptcy in the United States">federal bankruptcy law</a> in 1898.</p>

<p>Under the Compact Clause, states may not, without the consent of Congress, keep troops or armies during times of peace.

<p>The idea of allowing Congress to have say over agreements between states traces back to the numerous controversies that arose between various colonies. Eventually compromises would be created between the two colonies and these compromises would be submitted to <a href="/wiki/The_Crown" title="The Crown">the Crown</a> for approval. After the <a href="/wiki/American_Revolutionary_War" title="American Revolutionary War">American Revolutionary War</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Articles_of_Confederation" title="Articles of Confederation">Articles of Confederation</a> allowed states to appeal to Congress to settle disputes between the states over boundaries or "any cause whatever".

<p>There have been a number of <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States" title="Supreme Court of the United States">Supreme Court</a> cases concerning what constitutes valid congressional consent to an <a href="/wiki/Interstate_compact" title="Interstate compact">interstate compact</a>.

Indeed, the word 'sole' appears only one other time in the Constitution-with respect to the House of Representatives' "<i>sole</i> Power of Impeachment." The commonsense meaning of the word 'sole' is that the Senate alone shall have authority to determine whether an individual should be acquitted or convicted. The dictionary definition bears this out.... The history and contemporary understanding of the impeachment provisions support our reading of the constitutional language.... [T]he Judiciary, and the Supreme Court in particular, were not chosen to have any role in impeachments.... [J]udicial review would be inconsistent with the Framers' insistence that our system be one of checks and balances.... Judicial involvement in impeachment proceedings, even if only for purposes of judicial review, is counterintuitive because it would eviscerate the 'important constitutional check' placed on the Judiciary by the Framers. [It would be an improper reading of the Constitution to] place final reviewing authority with respect to impeachments in the hands of the same body that the impeachment process is meant to regulate.... In addition to the textual commitment argument,... the lack of finality and the difficulty of fashioning relief counsel against justiciability.... [O]pening the door of judicial review to the procedures used by the Senate in trying impeachments would 'expose the political life of the country to months, or perhaps years, of chaos.'"
